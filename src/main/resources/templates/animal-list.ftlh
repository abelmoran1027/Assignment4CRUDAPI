				<h2>Dolphins</h2>
				<p>Dolphins are one of my favorite animals because of their intelligence. Dolphins are extremely smart mammals and are very social animals. They 
					have saved people from drowning, and even socialized ones have been seen playing with humans for amusement. Some dolphins have the ability 
					to shut off half of their brains while sleeping to keep an eye out for predators.  </p>

				<h2>Horses</h2>
				<p>I think horses are amazing because they are capable of understanding human emotions and can react accordingly. They are also extremely fun to
					ride and can be very helpful for farm work. Horses have been used for combat and work purposes for centuries and are still used today. 
					That's why they earned their spot on the list. </p>

				<h2>Elephants</h2>
				<p>I think elephants are really cool because of their size. Some elephants can weigh up to 12,000 pounds and can somehow still swim. How cool is that?
					They also have a trunk that can be used like a hand, a hose, and a nutcracker. They can eat up to 330 pounds a day and can live to be 70 years old. </p>

				<h2>Sharks</h2>
				<p>Sharks have earned their spot on this list because of their coolness. Sharks can have thousands of teeth throughout their lifetime and come in all 
					shapes and sizes. Some studies say that sharks have been around before the dinosaurs, dating back almost 500 million years. Some species of sharks
					can have babies on their own.</p>

				<h2>Dogs</h2>
				<p>I believe dogs are the absolute best animals in the world. They are known to do all sorts of jobs for us. They work for the police, help on farms, 
					assist the handicapped, help with hunting, in combat, and so much more. They love to play and can even be taught tricks. </p>
